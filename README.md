## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.

## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code

```python
import time
import board
import touchio
import pwmio
import servo

pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A3, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

touch_A1 = touchio.TouchIn(board.A1)  # Not a touch pin on Trinket M0!
touch_A2 = touchio.TouchIn(board.A2)  # Not a touch pin on Trinket M0!

while True:
    if touch_A1.value:
        print("Touched A1!")
        my_servo.angle = 90
    time.sleep(0.05)
    if touch_A2.value:
        print("Touched A3!")
        my_servo.angle = 0
    time.sleep(0.05)

```
